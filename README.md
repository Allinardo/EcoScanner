ECOSCANNER 0.55 - Developed in Python by Allinardo
-------------------------------------------------


HOW TO USE


1. If you do not currently have the latest version of Python installed, I highly encourage you to do so. If you run "Install Dependencies.bat" it should install Python for you and add it to your Windows PATH. If you would rather install it straight from the source, download the latest version here.

https://www.python.org

You can find out how to add Python to Windows PATH here:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6318156/adding-python-to-path-on-windows

From there, run "Install Dependencies.bat" to install the Python dependencies needed to run this project.

2. Open ecoscanner-0.55y.pyw

If Python is installed correctly, you should be able to run it like an ordinary program

3. Make sure the Eco installation location is inputted at the top. Click the "Eco Game Folder..." button to locate it. Auto-Detect will also usually work.

4. Click on the big "PARSE" button. Give the program a minute and it will index every item within the game. You can search through the items, find what items are used in what recipes, find what workbench is required and what resources are required to craft any given item, and anything else you can imagine an index like this would do.

5. I strongly advise against using the Admin Tools unless you know what you are doing
